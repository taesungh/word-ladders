# word-ladders

Simple web app to visualize transitions in a solution to the word ladder/doublets puzzle.\
Created using ReactJS.

## Live Preview
<WIP>

## Notable Features
* Uses scroll position for fluid progression of letters between words
* responsive letter sizes
* Attempts to transition between individual character shapes
* uses a weighted conversion system that considers word frequencies

## Current Issues
* SVG interpolation does not look great without stencil typeface (may consider hand cleaning individual transitions)
* path interpolation fails on certain characters depending on typeface
* digram kerning could be improved
